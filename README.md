UW Capstone project 2020



## Background
-----------
Product Wheel is the name of a production planning method used in many industries where multiple types of products are made on a single manufacturing line of equipment. 

Implementing the Product Wheel helps to schedule the manufacturing process with a standard production sequence. It helps to eliminate frequent repetition of low volume products and simplifies changeovers so that throughput increases, inventory stock decreases, and product delivery performance increases. In addition, having standard patterns and predictable inventory requirements dramatically reduce the number of rush jobs to be scheduled, and provide the schedulers more bandwidth to manage the rush orders that do come in. 

Despite these many benefits, Product Wheel design, in reality, is often not optimal. Manufacturers may use old-established principles, that may not be robust enough. 

In this project, we will try to apply Machine Learning methods to evaluate effects of different input process parameters on a chemical manufacturing of a product with codename "Corian", in order to optimize Product Wheel, minimize the amount of scrap material during product types changeover, and reduce production cost as a result.

## Future work
-----------
Right now we only use transition time as well as transition sheet as our standard for the annual transition cost and  we only have limited datasets and lack the data of the inventory carrying costs. So in the future, we might consider more factors to determine the annual transition cost. Besides, we hope we can obtain more data from companies and the inventory carrying costs to achieve the total product wheel cost.
